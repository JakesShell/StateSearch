# StateSearch
This repository contains a Java application called StateSearchApp, designed to help users search for state names within a predefined list of U.S. states. The application features a simple menu-driven interface that allows users to display all state names or search for specific patterns within them.

<b>Key Features:</b>

-State List: The app includes a complete list of the 50 U.S. states stored in an array.
-Menu Navigation: Users can easily navigate through options to display the list of states or perform searches.
-Pattern Search: The application implements the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm for efficient searching of user-defined patterns within the state names.

<b>How It Works:</b>

-Display Menu: Users are presented with a menu to either display the list of states, search for a pattern, or exit the application.
-Display States: When the user selects the option to display states, the application prints all 50 states to the console.
-Search Functionality: Users can enter a search pattern, and the application utilizes the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find and display the indices of matches within the concatenated state names.
-Exit Option: Users can exit the application gracefully.

This project serves as a practical example of basic Java programming concepts, including user input handling, string manipulation, and efficient searching algorithms. It's an excellent resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of these topics while working on a real-world application.
